# BlackJack

This is a simplified version of the popular card game, BlackJack. This project was created as part of the course "2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python
".

The rules of the game are simple:

1) You have an initial amount.
2) You place a bet from your initial amount. Losing the round means losing the money you bet. If you win, the computer dealer will pay you the amount you betted.
3) Both you and the computer dealer are handed two cards from the deck. Only one card of the computer is face up.
4) The goal is to get closer to 21 than the computer.
5) You can choose to hit (pick more cards) or stay.
6) If the value of your cards exceeds 21, you bust and lose. Bear in mind the cards have the same value as the number they bear. The face cards are valued at 10 whereas ace is 1.
7) Once you stay, it is now the computer's turn.
8) The computer keeps hitting until it either busts and you win or its cards' value exceeds that of your cards and it wins.
9) You can play as many rounds as you want.
10) Once the game ends, your total number of wins and losses is displayed.
